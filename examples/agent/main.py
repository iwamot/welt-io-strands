"""A small AgentCore agent that Welt can drive.

Receives Welt's payload, feeds it to a Strands agent, and yields the
renderable subset of its `stream_async` events — the AgentCore Runtime SDK
emits each one as SSE, which Welt (https://github.com/iwamot/welt) renders
into Slack. The payload carries one of two envelopes: Converse-shaped
`messages` for a conversation turn, or `interrupt_responses` when a human
answered the approval buttons of an interrupted run.

This example is a standalone deployable; Welt drives it only through the
JSON wire contract, which welt-io adapts in both directions.
